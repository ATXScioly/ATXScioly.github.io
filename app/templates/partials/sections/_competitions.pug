        p As many of you might have heard, Austin has issued a city-wide mandatory boil water notice. This means that <strong>water fountains will not be available</strong> on the UT Campus during the tournament. The city has stated that water use is safe for activities such as bathing and laundry, but any water intended for consumption should be boiled. With this in mind, we urge you to bring water supplies for your team. Vending machines and stores will still carry bottled water as well. Many restaurants on Guadalupe Street, which borders the UT Campus, might be closed as well. For more information on the boil water notice, please visit <a href="https://austintexas.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer">austintexas.gov</a>. Your and your students' safety is of paramount importance to us.
