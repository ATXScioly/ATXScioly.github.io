The organizationâ€™s goals are to foster enthusiasm and interest in STEM, as well as promoting teamwork, sportsmanship, and the spirit of competition, by establishing new Science Olympiad teams in schools where such extracurriculars are not currently present, mentoring students in STEM subjects outside of the classroom curriculum, and providing opportunities for competition. </p></div></section><section id="competitions"><div class="container"><h2>2018 Fall Invitational</h2><h3>Tournament Update</h3><p>Tournament headquarters for check in, information, etc will be in <strong>Mezes Hall</strong>.

This means that <strong>water fountains will not be available</strong> on the UT Campus during the tournament. The city has stated that water use is safe for activities such as bathing and laundry, but any water intended for consumption should be boiled. With this in mind, we urge you to bring water supplies for your team. Vending machines and stores will still carry bottled water as well. Many restaurants on Guadalupe Street, which borders the UT Campus, might be closed as well. For more information on the boil water notice, please visit <a href="https://austintexas.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer">austintexas.gov</a>. Your and your students' safety is of paramount importance to us.</p><h3>Details</h3><p>The 2018 UT Austin Invitational tournament will be held on <strong>October 27, 2018</strong> at the University of Texas at Austin.</p><p>The tournament will feature tests written by faculty as well as experienced former competitors.
